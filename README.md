# Predicting Airline Passenger Satisfaction

## Project Overview

This project evaluates and compares two machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), for predicting airline passenger satisfaction. The task involves binary classification to determine whether passengers are classified as 'Satisfied' or 'Neutral or dissatisfied' based on various attributes. Through detailed analysis, this project not only assesses the effectiveness of these models but also extracts actionable insights from the data to guide airline management in enhancing passenger satisfaction.

## Objectives
- Critically evaluate the performance of SVM and MLP models for predicting airline passenger satisfaction.
- Compare key performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to identify the strengths and limitations of each model.
- Provide insights into factors influencing passenger satisfaction, offering actionable recommendations for improving customer experience.
- Address overfitting and generalisation concerns through model design and hyperparameter tuning.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the application of machine learning models to predict airline passenger satisfaction, offering actionable insights for service improvement. While SVM exhibited strong accuracy, its overfitting tendency suggests opportunities for regularisation. Meanwhile, MLP balanced performance and efficiency, providing a robust alternative for generalised predictions.

By uncovering factors influencing passenger satisfaction, such as service quality and punctuality, this analysis equips airline management with data-driven strategies to enhance customer experience and operational excellence.
